Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pavel, and you've landed on my webpage.

I bring over a decade of experience in software development, along with around two years of engineering management under my belt.

My career kicked off in the telecom sector, where I delved into hardware, TCP/IP stack, and software-defined networking using C/C++. After spending roughly five years in embedded programming, I made a switch to the Java world and eventually transitioned to backend development. Along the way, I honed my skills in databases, message brokers, microservices, observability, and team management.

Since 2022, I've been residing in Berlin, where I'm deeply involved in working with Kotlin.
